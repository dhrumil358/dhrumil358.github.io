    <section id="abstract">
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Every year around 70,000 wildfires occur worldwide, destroying forests and rendering them unfit for vegetation growth. This project proposes a computer vision-based deep learning model that can detect and alert for forest fires. Built using Python libraries like NumPy, OpenCV, and TensorFlow, this system provides early warnings, which are crucial for mitigating wildfire damage.</p>
